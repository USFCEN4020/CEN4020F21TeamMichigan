# inCollege

For the inCollege app from team Michigan

\*To use inCollege run
python inCollege.py

\*We're using postgresql
Create database type:
CREATE DATABASE incollege;

Please note: (host='localhost', port='5432', database='incollege', user='postgres', password='3600'), thanks.

\*To set up your python 3 environment with the necessary libraries you'll need to install the packages in the requirements.txt
just look up 'psycopg2 install [inset your os]'

list of all tables in the database with column names:
    auth:
        username, password, first_name, last_name
    control:
        username, email, sms, advertising, language
    experiences:
        username, title, employer, date_started, date_ended, location, description
    education:
        username, school, degree, year_attended
    friends:
        user_1, user_2, pending
		
		
\*For testing this program the DATABASE incollege must be created like so on line 12 of the ReadMe. The tables need not be 
created individualaly simply run the 'python inCollege.py' one time and this create all the tables needed for testing the code.

Command to clear all prior data: 'DROP TABLE profile; DROP TABLE  jobs; DROP TABLE friends; DROP TABLE experiences; DROP TABLE control; DROP TABLE education; DROP TABLE auth;'
